# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, *how* we design our code is just as important as the code itself. In this  assignment, I built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Usage
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
